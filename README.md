# CitadelManager

Laravel based client management platform. This web application provides a administration dashboard from which content filtering clients can be managed. The client's individual client-side applications can be configured with a simple drag and drop interface (for applying filtering list), and simple toggles for enabling and disabling features.

Administrators can upload content (filtering lists) which are then processed and stored in-database and packaged into downloadable zip files when applied to client profiles as described above.

This project is renamed and archived because PHP is a vastly inferior web technology no matter how sweet laravel may seem, and I only used it because a sponsor at the time couldn't work with anything else.
